                Lose something every day. Accept the fluster<br>
                of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.<br>
                The art of losing isn't hard to master.<br><br>
                Then practice losing farther, losing faster:<br>
                places, and names, and where it was you meant<br>
                to travel. None of these will bring disaster.<br><br>
                I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, or<br>
                next-to-last, of three loved houses went.<br>
                The art of losing isn't hard to master.<br><br>
                I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,<br>
                some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.<br>
                I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.<br><br>
                —Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture<br>
                I love) I shan't have lied. It's evident<br>
                the art of losing's not too hard to master<br>
                though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.

                "The specifications of everything here are similarly irrelevant.<br>
                I posted the initial reed photo in an attempt to help people relax and focus on more important things, but I still got at least one (always polite and flattering) PM a day saying, "yeah, but can you please tell me what XYZ you use and what are the exact measurements of your ABC?"<br>
                Here is why my/your/your teacher's/Big Fancy Man's reed/undergarment measurements and specifications actually don't matter:<br><br>
                1) Our bodies/faces/mouths/teeth/lungs are all different. Our needs and materials are ever-changing.<br><br>
                2) We have to know what we want first or it's all a total waste of time. No one wants numbers and data points. Often, we don't know what we want or aren't even happy when we get what we initially thought we wanted.<br><br>
                3) We want this stuff to be awesome and supportive, but can totally live without it being that way.<br><br>
                4) Actual skill lies is in being able to make the most of one's imperfections.<br><br>
                5) Too many options can be distracting.<br><br>
                These are all the things I use for measuring, in this photo. I got the micrometer for $25. I could enumerate the reasons it is better than the many-hundreds-of-dollars ones, but the main one is that I don't spend hours measuring every little part of my reed, which would be a total waste of time because of #3. I get to spend that time doing better things.<br>
                So, I think it's better to focus on what you are creating with all your junk."

              There was once a farmer in ancient China who owned a horse. “You are so lucky!” his neighbours told him, “to have a horse to pull the cart for you.” “Maybe,” the farmer replied.
            </p>
            <p>
              One day he didn't latch the gate properly and the horse ran away. “Oh no! That is terrible news!” his neighbours cried. “Such bad luck!” “Maybe,” the farmer replied.
            </p>
            <p>
              A few days later the horse returned, bringing with it six wild horses. “How fantastic! You are so lucky,” his neighbours told him. “Maybe,” the farmer replied.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following week the farmer's son was breaking-in one of the wild horses when it threw him to the ground, breaking his leg. “Oh no!” the neighbours cried. “Such bad luck, all over again!” “Maybe,” the farmer replied.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next day soldiers came and took away all the young men to fight in the army. The farmer's son was left behind. “You are so lucky!” his neighbours cried. “Maybe,” the farmer replied.
