                      <p>I had difficulty finding a video that had a demonstration of the exact steps for knife sharpening in the way that I was first taught - using a stone, crock sticks, and finishing with a burnishing rod.

                      <p>Despite being in Germany, I found the shipping price to be reasonable. Of course, the shipping time may be a few weeks, but if you order in advance the prices make it worth it.</p>
                      <ul><p><a href="https://www.oboe-shop.de/en/cane/tube-cane/oboe/">Tube cane</a> - I have found their tube cane cost to be really rather affordable compared to almost every US store. Lots of budget cane options too, like the Rouch√© and Carmen options. Vic is notably cheaper on here than most US stores.</p></ul>

                      <p>Great prices on a lot of items. Their cane used to be lower than many other sellers, but it appears to have gone up. It might still be lower than other stores, but will need additional checking. The Innoledy Chinese cane is affordable for beginners. They offer free shipping at as low as $50, which is a great offer. Can have long shipping times and can be difficult to get in contact with. Products to check out:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><p><a href="http://innoledy.com/supp-toolcases.html">Wilson tool cases</a> - good price on these great travel tool bags.</p></li>
                        <li><a href="http://innoledy.com/oboe_supp-mandrels.html">Guercio mandrel</a> - low price to go with their <a href="http://innoledy.com/oboe_supp-staples.html">Guercio Glotin copies</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://innoledy.com/supp-sharpening.html">Ceramic (crock) sticks</a> - a good price for small or regular length crock sticks</li>
                        <li><p>Seems like they have low prices on their easel and cutting blocks.</p></li>
                        <li><p>While the thread has great color selections and a very long length for the price, I would suggest avoiding their thread, as the spool is only stopped on one side. More than once I had the thread get tangled up because of the lack of a double-sided stopper and ended up needing to cut off a huge chunk of the thread.</p></li>

A great product from this is this <a href="https://hodgeproductsinc.com/20-reed-wood-oboe-reed-case-by-oboes-ch/">20-reed case</a>, which you will not find at this low of a price likely anywhere else.
