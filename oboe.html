                            <h3>22 for 2022</h1>
                            <p>
                              Here is a list of 22 pieces I think oboists should be playing and teaching in 2022. They should have and may have been enjoyed (sometimes long) before this. As I am terrible at list making and it causes me anxiety, I actually deliver 25 composers here instead of 22. Think of my counting as approximate. And for some composers, I list multiple pieces. Brevity is not my strong suit. If I don’t specify instrumentation, it’s for oboe/piano or oboe solo.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Yesterday, I made another imperfect list of ***THE 31 Most Popular Works for Oboe Lessons, Recitals, Competitions, and School Auditions***. I was thinking of including a token piece by somebody who was a woman and/or a person of color because we definitely see people trying to branch out on occasion. But I just couldn’t think of any options that were as truly mainstream as the rest of the pieces on that list. There are a number of pieces on that first list I truly love, and there are a few I cannot abide.
                              If you've played all or most of the pieces on my ***31 Most Popular*** list, or even a decent fraction of them but only ever a token piece or few by a woman composer and/or a composer of color, please check out my ***22 for 2022*** list.
                              I see so many students playing one or two movements of many of the pieces from my **31 Most Popular List*** because the whole pieces are just too hard for them (Poulenc, Saint-Säens, Vaughan-Williams, Schumann, Marcello, Hindemith, Mozart, Strauss.) Instead of studying something you won’t be able to play in its entirety yet, I’ve put asterisks on pieces in this newest list which might be currently manageable if you can handle the easiest movements of some of the big pieces in the ***31 Most Popular.***
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              I have very good to loving feelings about every piece on this list. This is more than I can say for my ***31 Most Popular List***. I am sure this list is wildly imperfect and missing a ton; it was hard for me to keep it as short as it is. It's always exciting to find new, great pieces that have been either completely ignored or not given their due. Please let me know what you think I should've put here. Maybe it will find its way onto another list!

                      <p>Great prices on a lot of items. Their cane used to be lower than many other sellers, but it appears to have gone up. It might still be lower than other stores, but will need additional checking. The Innoledy Chinese cane is affordable for beginners. They offer free shipping at as low as $50, which is a great offer. Can have long shipping times and can be difficult to get in contact with. Products to check out:</p>

                        <li><a href="http://innoledy.com/supp-sharpening.html">Ceramic (crock) sticks</a> - a good price for small or regular length crock sticks</li>
                        <li><p>Seems like they have low prices on their easel and cutting blocks.</p></li>
                        <li><p>While the thread has great color selections and a very long length for the price, I would suggest avoiding their thread, as the spool is only stopped on one side. More than once I had the thread get tangled up because of the lack of a double-sided stopper and ended up needing to cut off a huge chunk of the thread.</p></li>

                      <p>They sell lots of products, and often have sales, which a lot of other websites rarely provide. A great product from them is this <a href="https://hodgeproductsinc.com/20-reed-wood-oboe-reed-case-by-oboes-ch/">20-reed case</a>, which you will not find at this low of a price likely anywhere else. It holds up strong despite its price, and you can even pick from 3 different finishes.</p>

                      <p>The <a href="https://www.nielsen-woodwinds.com/en/knife-wedge-aka-the-nielsen-knife">Nielsen Knife</a> is strikingly affordable and has several different handle sizes. It scrapes well and I'm able to use it for tip work and other full scrapes. By far my favorite knife at less than half the cost of something like a Landwell.</p>
